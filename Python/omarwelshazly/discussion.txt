According to the graphs, when the data set size increasing execution time of each sorting algorithm will be
increased. The reason for that is, when size of the data set increasing, number of operations for the sorting will also
be increased.

When considering selection sort algorithm, it has O(n^2) time complexity. Therefore, graph for selection
sort has a big gradient.

When considering merge sort algorithm, it has O(nlog(n)) time complexity. Therefore it has less gradient than
the selection sort.

Radix sort algorithm has O(nd) time complexity. In here d is the number of digits in the largest number.
This graph has the lowest gradient among these 3 sorting algorithms.
