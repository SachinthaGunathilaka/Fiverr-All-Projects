Explanation: The first person takes times 3 and 5 for jobs 1 and 2 respectively.
The second person takes times 10 and 1 for jobs 1 and 2 respectively.
We can see that the optimal assignment will be to give job 1 to person 1 and job 2 to person 2.
After getting each permutation we will iterate through the N jobs and calculate the
time taken to complete the task.
After calculating all the time taken we will we will
output the minimum time taken to complete the N jobs from all the permutations.
