1)  For searching, at what size of N does binary search regularly outperform linearSearch? What are the
    times.

    When N is less than 250, binary search is not faster than linear search.
    Ex :
        N         Linear Search Time                 Binary Search Time
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        20          5 microseconds                      5 microseconds
        50          6 microseconds                      7 microseconds
        100         6 microseconds                      6 microseconds
        250         6 microseconds                      6 microseconds



2) Compare run times for bubble sort and selection sort

   The efficiency of Selection sort algorithm is better when compared to Bubble sort algorithm.

       N         Linear Search Time                 Binary Search Time
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
       100        96 microseconds                     51 microseconds
       1000       3796 microseconds                   1728 microseconds
       10000      408275 microseconds                 170962 microseconds
